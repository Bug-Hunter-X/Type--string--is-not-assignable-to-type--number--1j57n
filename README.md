This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to take two numbers and return a number. However, in the example usage, a string is passed as an argument. This results in a compilation error because TypeScript's type system correctly identifies this as a type mismatch. The solution demonstrates how to resolve this by ensuring that all arguments passed to the function are of the correct type (numbers).
